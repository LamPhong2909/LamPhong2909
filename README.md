## About Me
I'm Phong D. Lam (english name: Fredrick Lam), engineering systems that work in the real world—from autonomous robots navigating chaos to AI detecting crop diseases in Vietnamese rice fields.

**Current Mission:** Building agricultural AI that serves 22M farmers. **Next Mission:** Immersive Software Engineering at JYU,
